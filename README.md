# *stats220*

## *About my purpose of creating this file*
* The first, of course, is because this is an assignment for my stats220, and it accounts for 4% of the total score! ! !
* Second, I like orange cats very much, especially I have no resistance to the chubby and fluffy creatures. It is very interesting to find that orange cats can always grow large.
* When writing the code I tried to combine separate functions as much as possible to make the program look cleaner. Didn't use any more functions, but will try next time.
